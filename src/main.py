    <div class="intro">
    Although many anti-theft technologies are implemented, auto-theft is still increasing. Security vulnerabilities of cars can be exploited for auto-theft by neutralizing anti-theft systems. This keyless auto-theft attack will increase as cars adopt computerized electronic devices more. To detect auto-theft efficiently, we propose a driver verification method that analyzes driving patterns using measurements from sensors in the vehicle.
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
    This project uses machine learning to profile and classify driving patterns, extracting valuable insights from real-world vehicular data. Additionally, with modern vehicles' extensive connectivity, protecting in-vehicle networks from cyber-attacks, particularly on the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol, has become essential. Due to its lack of security features, CAN is vulnerable to attacks like message injection.

    <div class="summary-title">Objectives</div>
    <div class="intro">
    <ul>
        <li>Develop machine learning models capable of profiling and classifying driving patterns using real-world vehicular data.</li>
        <li>Explore feature extraction techniques and data preprocessing methods to capture the characteristics of driving behavior.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the performance of the developed models in accurately identifying and categorizing different driving patterns.</li>
        <li>Create a web app to visualize the results of the model.</li>

    This application provides two main functionalities:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attack Classification</strong>: Detect and classify various types of cyber-attacks on in-vehicle networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Driver Classification</strong>: Profile and classify driving patterns to verify driver identity and detect abnormal behaviors.</li>
